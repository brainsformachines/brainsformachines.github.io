# Welcome to the Brainsformachines Wiki

## About

This wiki is a collection of posts for robotics engineers and others who want to learn more about the technologies used in robotics and artificial intelligence.

Main goal of this wiki is to provide the complete information needed to build an intelligent system that operates in the real world.

Most of the articles are about hardware that can be used to build robotic systems, but they also include information about algorithms, machine learning models, and development software.

## Robots

Here you can find materials on robots, which are divided into groups:

- [autonomous mobile robots](autonomous_mobile_robots) (AMR)
- legged robots
- unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
- humanoid robots
- self-driving cars

## Intelligent Agents

Here you can find materials on intelligent agents:

- intelligent agents in games and 3D world
- virtual assistants
- classical strategies for intelligent agents
- learning strategies for intelligent agents

## Electronics for Robots

Here you can find specifications for electronics modules which can be used for a robot:

- comparison of single-board computers
- motors and drivers for robot actuators
- sensors for robots
- power source modules
- interfaces and adapters
- machine vision modules

## Algorithms for Robots

Here you can find algorithms used to control robots:

- PID regulators and actuator controls
- navigation and SLAM
- trajectory planning
- group behavior

## Software for Robots

- ROS/ROS2
- Ardupilot
- PX4 Autopilot

## Robot Simulators
